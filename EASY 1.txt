EASY 1:
PROBLEM STATEMENT:
 Given a string s consisting of words and spaces, return the length of the last word in the string.A word is a maximal substring consisting of non-space characters only.
SOLUTION:
public class LastWordLength {

    public static int lengthOfLastWord(String s) {
 
        s = s.trim();

        int length = 0;
        int index = s.length() - 1;

   
        while (index >= 0 && s.charAt(index) != ' ') {
            length++;
            index--;
        }

        return length;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        System.out.println(lengthOfLastWord("Hello World"));  // Output: 5
        System.out.println(lengthOfLastWord("   fly me   to   the moon  "));  // Output: 4
        System.out.println(lengthOfLastWord("luffy is still joyboy"));  // Output: 6
    }
}

SUMMARY AND ALGORITHM:
The provided Java code defines a class named `LastWordLength` that contains a method `lengthOfLastWord` designed to calculate the length of the last word in a given string. The main method includes several test cases to demonstrate the functionality of the `lengthOfLastWord` method.

Algorithm:
1. lengthOfLastWord Method:
   - The input string `s` is first trimmed to remove leading and trailing spaces.
   - Initialize variables `length` to 0 and `index` to the last index of the string (`s.length() - 1`).
   - A while loop iterates backward from the end of the string (`index`) until it encounters a space character or reaches the beginning of the string.
   - Inside the loop, the `length` variable is incremented for each character that is not a space.
   - The final length of the last word is returned.

2. main Method:
   - Test cases are provided to demonstrate the functionality of the `lengthOfLastWord` method.
   - The results of the test cases are printed using `System.out.println`.

Example Test Cases and Expected Outputs:

System.out.println(lengthOfLastWord("Hello World"));  // Output: 5
System.out.println(lengthOfLastWord("   fly me   to   the moon  "));  // Output: 4
System.out.println(lengthOfLastWord("luffy is still joyboy"));  // Output: 6


These test cases cover scenarios with leading/trailing spaces, multiple spaces between words, and different word lengths. The `lengthOfLastWord` method is expected to accurately calculate the length of the last word in each case.
